# UDP Flood DOS

This tool will send mass amounts of UDP packets, it warns you about fragmentation, and is easy to use. Do not use maliciously, not that you really could with a 1 device setup, and this script isnt very good anyways.

## How to Use
Using this tool is really simple.
1. Download this project, unzip it, where ever you want.
2. Open up your prefered terminal and CD into it
3. Run "python command.py". It will output a template for you to use
 - Example: python main.py IP PORT -s 1500
4. Format with your desired information.
 - Example: python main.py 23.143.152.86 53 -s 1500 -r 0

Run the command, and boom, there you go.
